						<div class="">A leader is anyone who:</div>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">Has <strong>responsibility</strong> for completing a task.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Solicits <strong>feedback</strong> from others to improve their own work.</li>
							<li class="fragment">Values <strong>teamwork and collaboration</strong>.</li>
						</ul>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Why would I want to be a "leader"?</h3>
						<ul>
							<li class="fragment">You feel more ownership of your tasks.</li>
							<li class="fragment">You take on a perspective of problem-solving.</li>
							<li class="fragment">You find it much easier to get help and collaborate.</li>
						</ul>
						<p><strong class="fragment">Viewing yourself as a leader enables you to be a better team player.</strong></p>

						<h3>Here's a few questions to think about.</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Does a good leader need to know how to do everything?</p>

						<h3>FIRST sees its programs as grounded in mentorship.</h3>

						<div>
							<span class="fragment">Who are FIRST Mentors and Coaches? Our team members say it best. A Mentor/Coach:</span>
							<ul>
								<li class="fragment">Can be a person of any age, teaching others what they know </li>
								<li class="fragment">Brings either technical or non-technical expertise to the team</li>
								<li class="fragment">Provides the opportunity for students to learn directly through experiences</li>
							</ul>

						<h3>Are mentors leaders?</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Do they have responsibility for any tasks?</p>
						<p class="fragment">Are they expected to improve their own work through feedback?</p>
						<p class="fragment">Do they set the standard for the team?</p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>If mentors aren't leaders, what are they?</h3>
						<p class="fragment">FIRST describes them as <span class="fragment">teachers, </span><span class="fragment">experts, </span><span class="fragment">but not <strong>doers</strong>.</span></p>
						<p class="fragment">Mentors don't lead.<span class="fragment"> <span class="fragment">They are a resource for successful leaders.</span></p>

						<h1>How can I make good use of mentors?</h1>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3><span class="fragment grow">Listen</span> to what they have to say.</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Mentors aren't leaders, they aren't telling you what to do.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Even if they don't fully understand your situation, odds are they have some ideas that can help.</p>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>When a mentor is talking to you, wait a minute before thinking how you'll respond to them.</strong></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Remember that nobody expects you to know everything.</h3>
						<p class="fragment">Smart people often don't want to accept help because it makes them feel foolish.</p>
						<p class="fragment">Wise people know better--knowing when to ask for help is the difference between success and failure.</p>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>If you have zero ideas on how to move forward, ask for some inspiration. You'll be glad you did.</strong></p>
					</section>
					<section>
						<h3>Share what you're doing with your mentors.</h3>
						<p class="fragment">It's a chance to communicate what you've done (and how awesome it is).</p>
						<p class="fragment">It makes your mentor feel like they're a part of the team, and they might point out something useful in the process.</p>
						<p class="fragment"><strong>Sharing your work lets you feel proud of your accomplishments, and helps build the team.</strong></p>
					</section>

						<h1>So let's wrap up.</h1>

					<section>
						<h3>What did we talk about today?</h3>
						<p class="fragment">We established that anyone can be a leader on the team.</p>
						<p class="fragment">We talked about mentors being teachers and experts, but not doers.</p>
						<p class="fragment">We explained some of the ways leaders can effectively use mentors.</p>
